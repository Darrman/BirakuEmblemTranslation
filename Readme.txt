BIRAKU EMBLEM MENU TRANSLATION
V1.0, 01/05/2020

This is a patch that translates the menus of the romhack Biraku Emblem, which is based on Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem.

There are several patches available to apply to your rom. Please make sure you only apply one patch at a time and ensure you have a backup in case you make a mistake. 

Biraku Emblem was designed for a Japanese 1.1 headered rom initially. This should be 3,146,240 bytes in size.
ROM CRC32: A427B7E6.
If the header is missing, your rom will be 3,145,728 bytes large instead.
I'll also include a patch for 1.0 roms. These seem to be somewhat more prevelant. The checksum for an unheadered 1.0 rom is:
ROM CRC32: 25D214F4.
If you already have a Japanese Biraku Emblem, there will be a patch to translate it.

Known Issues:
Translation Issues:
*Many menus use awkward abbreviations due to limited space. These may be repointed into expanded rom space in a future release.
*Some names break their boxes due to length limitations. In particular, 8 character class names wrap around to the other side of the screen in combat. FE3 only has a small handful of classes use abberviated names, leaving the rest to overflow horribly.

Original Issues (see original readme):
*Don't suspend in Book 1 Ch3, Ch19, Book 2 Ch10, Ch13, Final-2. Additional characters will join when they shouldn't and cause issues. 
*Ballisticians don't always display correctly.
*One of the houses serves as a sound test in the first chapter of both books. If you enter it, you might be waiting for a while...
*Yes, Machis is in the game. But you can ignore him if you want, since he's irrevelant to the plot.

Rough Google Translation of original readme, somewhat revised so it's not too horribly broken:

Biraku Emblem v2.03
Book 1 is complete.
Book 2 is complete.

(Known Issues...)

In Book 1, the premise is "what if Hardin didn't stop in that fort in Orleans?"
In Book 2, the premise is "what if Nina married Marth instead of Hardin?" With that premise, the story of Book 2 will be told from Biraku's perspective. 

Difficulty: Book 1's enemies are strong, but so are your allies. It feels easy.
Book 2's enemies are stronger.

Changelog:
*Recruitable characters have significantly changed.
*Character relationships have somewhat changed.
*Enemy placement and strength has been slightly changed.
*Village and chest rewards and shop contents have been completely changed.
*Some item effects have been changed.
*Character levels do not reset on promotion. Biraku is an exception to this.
*Levels will quickly cap and there aren't as many reinforcements.
*Reinforcement chance is now always 100%.
*Horsemen can promote with an Orion's Bolt. Hunters can't promote.
*Female mages can no longer promote.

The general mechanics haven't really changed.
Growth rates are identical, with two exceptions in Book 1.

FAQ:
Q: The names are overflowing!
A: You'll get used to it.
Q: Whoever's talking. But he's dead!
A: Making an alternate version is effort.
Q: I can't visit some villages.
A: Wolf will join in these villages. If he's already recruited, they will close.
Q: Can I distribute the patch if the download disappears?
A: Go ahead.

Secrets:
*Portraits change when loading from suspend!
*Ballistas get more move on reload!

Strategy:
*Recruitment hints can be heard in houses. Without a house to visit, fight them.
*Support bonuses increase hit rate and reduce crit rate. Make good use of these.
*Since levels don't reset, promote at level 10. This is especially true when the unit's HP is below the class base: 28 for generals and 24 for snipers.
*Only Biraku's level resets on promotion; he's the main character. Still, don't wait to promote him. The promotion bonuses are far more valuable than the additional levels.
*Don't lose. Assume you will get crit.
