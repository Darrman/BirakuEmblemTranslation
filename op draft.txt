[i]Ngh... this is terrible... House Akaneia must truly be cursed. As you know, two years ago... Hardin and Princess Nina were wed. In order to restore Akaneia to glory, a king was needed. There were but two suitable individuals: King Orleans's younger brother, Duke Hardin, and you, Prince Marth of Aritia... Princess Nina begged me to wait just a while longer, but once I insisted of its absolute urgency... She said that it could not be you, for Princess Sheeda would grieve. In the end, Hardin was our only choice...[/i]
